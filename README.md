# CNOI-problems

English statements of Chinese OI problems. Visit [here](https://megaowier.github.io/CNOI-problems/) to check the statements.

You can find most of the files mentioned in the site above (statements in Chinese, extra samples, etc.) in `files/`.

If you find some of my translation vague, you can look up the Chinese statement and use Google translate.
Sorry if my poor English does make you confused.

By the way, anyone is welcomed to contribute translations or help to correct the mistakes.
