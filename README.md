# CNOI-problems

English statements of Chinese OI problems.

For each contest, you are provided with the following things:

+ A `.pdf` file (Chinese statement)
+ Some Markdown files (English statement)
+ A `.zip` or `.rar` file (Sample datas)

If you find some of my translation vague, you can look up the Chinese statement and use Google translate.

Sorry if my poor English does make you confused.

By the way, anyone is welcomed to contribute translations or help to correct the mistakes.
