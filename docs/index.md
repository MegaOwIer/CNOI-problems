# CNOI Problem Archive

This is an online archive of English statements of Chinese OI problems.

You can find most of the files mentioned in this site (statements in Chinese, extra samples, etc.) in [the repository](https://github.com/MegaOwIer/CNOI-problems/files).

If you find some of my translation vague, you can look up the Chinese statement and use Google translate.
Sorry if my poor English does make you confused.

By the way, anyone is welcomed to contribute translations or help to correct the mistakes.
